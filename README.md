This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to

Two steps:

### `npm run build` to build the app

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Load the app as a Chrome extension

You can now load the extension by going to `chrome://extensions/`, activating `Developer mode`, pressing `Load unpacked` and pointing Chrome to the `./build` directory.
